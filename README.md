# unity_rubiks_cube
A fully functional rubiks cube that can be solved using the a mouse and keyboard. Future plan is to make an automatic cube solving algorithm that works with any size.


The cube can indeed be any number of dimensions, however in the interest of performance i have limited the number of cubies to 20 x 20
